# FreeOHLC
A website that provides free access to open, high, low, and close stock statistics as that data should be free.
The premise behind this is that this data is mostly available but it seems like a lot of it seems to not be available
for free as it's packaged with other products to increase the price of this minimal set. This website is an answer to
this as it will always be free and its niche will be that it will only provide OHLC data and maybe a symbology mapping
for what we use which is be CQS symbology as that is cross nasdaq and nyse/arca.
